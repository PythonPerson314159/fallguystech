<p>I first became aware of this strategy in a map I was playing. Sadly I don’t remember the name of it, and while I bet a subset of people know about it (and probably have a different name for it), I’m making this page to attempt to make it more well known. So, if you’d like, share this!</p>

<h2>How to perform the “chicken buffer”</h2>

<ol>

    <li>Get the rubber chicken powerup.</li>
    <li>Dive off the ledge.</li>
    <li>Use the chicken powerup.</li>
    <li>Dive - again! That’s right, when you use the chicken powerup, the game resets your dive count.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 3 and 4 for as long as you can or until your reach your target.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Performance tips</h2>
<ul>

    <li>If you want to cover a significant amount of extra distance with this trick, Step 3 and 4 must be done in quick succesion. If the only major time you’re not doing anything is when you’re waiting for the power-up cooldown to finish, you’re doing this correctly.</li>
    <li>Using PlayStation remotes, I find that sliding your finger across from circle to square works very well for performing those critical two steps.</li>
</ul>

<p class="final">Happy buffering!</p>
